        fetch - FetchType (defaults to EAGER)
        Defines whether this attribute should be fetched eagerly or lazily. JPA says that EAGER is a requirement to the
        provider (Hibernate) that the value should be fetched when the owner is fetched, while LAZY is merely a hint that
        the value is fetched when the attribute is accessed.

        The Hibernate recommendation is to statically mark all associations lazy and to use dynamic fetching strategies
        for eagerness. (me as I am using only hibernate related classes, I get this behaviour even for )
        This is unfortunately at odds with the JPA specification which defines that all one-to-one and many-to-one
        associations should be eagerly fetched by default.
        Hibernate, as a JPA provider, honors that default.
