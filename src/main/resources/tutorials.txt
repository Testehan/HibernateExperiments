    Regarding Level 2 cache hibernate
        I used a newer version of ehcache lib (3.x) and because of this, I had to use a different hibernate lib, hibernate-jcache
        and also I had to introduce a config file for ehcache called ehcache.xml.  Also the properties from hibernate.cfg.xml
        regarding L2 caching are different than the tutorial, because of this.

        By following the tutorial from the playlist, I got into a weird problem in which the execution of the program
        would not stop. (hence I found out about some incompatibilities between what hibernate version I was using and
        the ehcache version.)

        The issue was fixed by following the instructions here :

        Conversely, a second-level cache is SessionFactory-scoped, meaning it's shared by all sessions created with
        the same session factory.

        We already mentioned that we have to explicitly indicate that a collection (OneToMany or ManyToMany
        association) is cacheable, otherwise it isn't cached.

   ResultTransformer has been deprecated. In Hibernate 6 it is replaced by some new interfaces. Until now an alternative
   would be the suggestion from this page, https://vladmihalcea.com/hibernate-resulttransformer/ that I applied.

Entire documentation of hibernate 5.6.12
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.6/userguide/html_single/

        fetch - FetchType (defaults to EAGER)
        Defines whether this attribute should be fetched eagerly or lazily. JPA says that EAGER is a requirement to the
        provider (Hibernate) that the value should be fetched when the owner is fetched, while LAZY is merely a hint that
        the value is fetched when the attribute is accessed.

        The Hibernate recommendation is to statically mark all associations lazy and to use dynamic fetching strategies
        for eagerness. (me as I am using only hibernate related classes, I get this behaviour even for )
        This is unfortunately at odds with the JPA specification which defines that all one-to-one and many-to-one
        associations should be eagerly fetched by default.
        Hibernate, as a JPA provider, honors that default.

        For implementing database sequence-based identifier value generation Hibernate makes use of its
        org.hibernate.id.enhanced.SequenceStyleGenerator id generator. It is important to note that SequenceStyleGenerator
        is capable of working against databases that do not support sequences by switching to a table as the underlying
        backing. This gives Hibernate a huge degree of portability across databases while still maintaining consistent
        id generation behavior (versus say choosing between SEQUENCE and IDENTITY). This backing storage is completely
        transparent to the user.
        The preferred (and portable) way to configure this generator is using the JPA-defined
        javax.persistence.SequenceGenerator annotation.
        The simplest form is to simply request sequence generation; Hibernate will use a single, implicitly-named
        sequence (hibernate_sequence) for all such unnamed definitions.

    Very important to do the equals and hashcode in the right way, otherwise when using Sets you can run into problematic
    scenarios (things to keep in mind: hibernate uses proxy objects, so getClass() is discouraged..see chapter
    "Implementing equality methods" for more details)
